# Proyecto-Alquiler: Module 1. Car Filter ('filtro-coches')
- The first idea, the car filter (filter-cars branch), deals with a predictive analysis of available cars based on a survey/questionnaire that is adjusted according to the customer's preferences by means of a questionnaire.
- In this branch, a class called 'Prediction' has been created, which includes the questionnaire mentioned above.
- This, is a single and specific lane, which separates this class ("Prediction.cpp") from the other branch wich corresponds to the other module.
