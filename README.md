# Proyecto-Alquiler: Module 2. List Cars ("lista-coches")
- The second idea, the list cars (list-cars branch), which is generated once the user/customer has finalized the rental purchases of the car selection. 
- In this branch, a class called 'Report' has been created, which includes the receipt of the previously mentioned rented cars.
- As the other module, this is a single and specific lane which separates this class ("Report.cpp") from the other branch that corresponds to the other module.
