# Proyecto-Alquiler: Module 1. Cars Filter Prediction ('filtro-coches')
- The first idea, the cars filter (cars-filter branch), deals with a predictive analysis of available cars based on a survey/questionnaire that is adjusted according to the customer's preferences by means of a questionnaire.
- In this branch, a class called 'Prediction' has been created, which includes the questionnaire mentioned above.
- This, is a single and specific lane, which separates this class ("Prediction.cpp") from the other branch. 
 This module is translated on the main branch.
