# Proyecto-Alquiler: Module 2. List Cars ("lista-coches)
The second is a list (list-cars branch), which is generated once the user/customer has finalized the rental purchases of the car selection. In that branch, a class called 'Report' has been created, which includes the receipt of the previously mentioned rented cars.
