# Proyecto-Alquiler: Module 2. Cars List Receipt ("lista-coches")
- The second idea, the cars list 'Purchases.txt' file (cars-list branch), will be generated once the user/customer has finalized the rental purchases of the car selection. 
- In this branch, a class called 'Report' has been created, which includes the receipt of the previously mentioned rented cars by each costumer.
- As the other module, this is a single and specific lane which separates this class ("Report.cpp") from the other branch.

  This module is translated on the main branch.
