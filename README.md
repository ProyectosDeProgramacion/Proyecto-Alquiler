# Proyecto-Alquiler: Module 1. Car Filter ('filtro-coches')
The first idea, the car filter (filter-cars branch), deals with a predictive analysis of available cars based on a survey/questionnaire that is adjusted according to the customer's preferences by means of a questionnaire. In that branch, a class called ("Prediction.cpp") has been created, which includes the questionnaire mentioned above. This branch is of a single and specific lane, which separates this class from the other branch corresponding to the other module.
